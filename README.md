This is a Rust application that compress files and folders.

## Installation

### Cargo (recommanded)

Install rustup by following the instructions at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)

Once installed, run `cargo install --locked quick-storer`, and it is available through the command `quick-storer`.

### Using prebuilt binaries

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/AL68-co/quick-storer/releases/latest), and download the executable corresponding to your computer. Put the binary somewhere in your `$PATH` if you want to use it from the command line and/or on your desktop if you want to use it using the drag-and-drop way.

## Usage

Drag-and-drop a file or a folder onto the executable. A compressed file is created, which you can decompress by drag-and-dropping onto the executable.  
Also works as a CLI app, try with `--help`.

## Support

Go to the [Issues page](https://github.com/AL68-co/quick-storer/issues).

## Roadmap

- Make the multi-file support better
- Create tests
